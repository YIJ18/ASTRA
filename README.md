## 📌 Features
- Real-time visualization of multiple sensor parameters  
- Dynamic, interactive charts and graphs  
- Integrated GPS maps showing sensor locations  
- Gyroscope support for responsive display  
- User-friendly interface optimized for learning  

---

## 🛠 Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support  
- Backend or API to fetch IoT sensor data (if applicable)  
- Libraries: Chart.js, Leaflet or equivalent mapping library
